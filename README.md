# practice-leetcode-questions
Repository for working on practice coding interview problems 

I will try to put as much of the question text itself. Don't know if that will be a seperate `.txt`/`.md` file or inside of the code as a comment.

I do NOT own the rights to any questions here. This repository is just for me to keep track of my progress working on these questions.


## Prefix Key

I like to put a prefix in the file name for all questions. These prefixes correspond to the source of the question. Here is the key for them:

| Prefix      | Name                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------|
